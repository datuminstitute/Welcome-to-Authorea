\section{Transdisciplinary Research with Social Impact}

We happen to believe that science and technology should be useful to society and that we have a responsibility to educate society about science and technology. We will be radically close to society by being aggressive in social media, by reaching people in nontraditional ways such as reddit AMAs, by engaging in nontraditional (for science anyways) fundraising such as kickstarter.com and by making science and technology outreach a hallmark of our institution. We want to attract socially mindful scientist that would want to collaborate with local (for that particular scientist) schools and universities. If the scientist wants, outreach could be considered for his or her review. Everyone in the institute will be strongly encouraged to adhere to open science principles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) which include: open data, open source, open methodology, open peer-review, open access and open educational resources. We will have members in the institute, everyone who contributes a little bit of money (like \$5) or volunteers time. Perks for them could be, for example, access to members of the institute during online "office hours," etc.
